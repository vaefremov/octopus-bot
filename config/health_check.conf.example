# Example configuration for scripts/health_check.sh
# This file can be used as a starting point for host-specific configuration.

# Filesystems to check: pairs of <path> <min_free_percent>
# Example: require at least 10% free on /, 5% on /tmp
filesystems=(/ 10 /tmp 5 /var 5)

# Processes to ensure are running: pairs of <process_name> <min_count>
# Uses pgrep -f to count matching processes
processes=(nginx 1 mysql 2)

# Swap usage threshold (percent). If swap usage > this value a report is emitted.
swap_threshold=20

# You can override this file location by passing -c /path/to/config to the script
# or by setting the HEALTH_CHECK_CONFIG environment variable.
